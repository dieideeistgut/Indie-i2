### ProjectName: RiotGirrl

Hello Folks! Finally my first build is in a stage where i dare to show it off. Maybe its helpfull for someone else.

I took Simons great idea for the Indie i2 and converted/upscaled it to run 200x200 or even 200x300 sized heated beds. Keeping the Nema 14s and as many parts like Simon designed them as possible. And to me it looks like this will work without any issues.
